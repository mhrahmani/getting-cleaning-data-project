The assignment files for Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data course.

this repo contains the R script "run_analysis.R", which will create a tidy dataset by doing
the following:

1. Merging the Train and Test data sets into one table using the "rbind" function

2. Extracting the Mean and the Standard Derivation measurments for each individual measurment.

3. renames the activities into meaningful names.

4. labeling the data set with descriptive activity names.

5. and finally, write the tidy data set using the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
